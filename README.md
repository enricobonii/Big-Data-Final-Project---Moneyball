# Big-Data-Final-Project---Moneyball
Big Data Modern Architectures Final Group Project. Performing data-driven football scouting as seen in the movie Moneyball.

This project was part of the 'Modern Data Architectures II' course in the second term of my master's. My team and I focused on applying web scraping techniques and leveraging various APIs to gather data on real football players, including their ratings and market values. Our goal was to perform data-driven football scouting, using statistics and market insights similar to the approach seen in the movie Moneyball. Check out our presentation on YouTube for a deeper dive into the project. Hereâ€™s the link:
